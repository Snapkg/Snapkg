> **Note:**
> *This project is still in early development, so some features may not work as advertised.*

## Key Features

* **Package management** - Add and remove custom Snap! blocks with ease.
  - Packages can be installed from a local or remote source.
* **Dependency resolution** - When installing a new package, Snapkg will automatically install any other required packages for you!
* **Automatic package updates** - Use Snapkg to receive the latest block updates from Snapkg developers and maintainers.
* **Easy to install and use!!**

## How To Use

The first step in using Snapkg is to actually install it. The easiest and recommended way is to use the ðŸ“¦**Snapkg Installer** block which will install the latest version of the other Snapkg blocks and initialize the Snapkg database.

### Installing Snapkg with the ðŸ“¦**Snapkg Installer** block

* Download the Snapkg Installer block.xml file
* Drag and drop the downloaded block.xml file to a new Snap! project
* Open the new "Snapkg" category in the block pallet and click on the ðŸ“¦**Snapkg Installer** block to install Snapkg.

### Adding a repository
Once Snapkg is installed, you can add the Snapkg repository. This will be your trusted source for custom Snapkg packages. To do this, you can click on the new ðŸ“¦**Add repository from [URL]** block under the Snapkg category in the block pallet.

### Updating repositories
In order to receive the latest information from the available packages in your repositories, you will next need to click on the ðŸ“¦**Update repositories** block. It's recommended to run this block anytime you're planning on adding new packages to your project or updating existing packages.

### Listing available packages
Once your local repositories are up-to-date, you can browse the list of available packages using the ðŸ“¦**List available packages** block.

> **Tip:**
> You can browse to a package's "provides" field to see the specs of the blocks a package provides.

### Installing or updating a package
Once you've found a package that you'd like to install, you can install it by using the ðŸ“¦**Install package by [Name]** block. Simply enter the name of the package that you'd like to install (or update) and run the block to install the package.

### Uninstalling a package
If you decide later that you no longer need a package that you installed, you can use the ðŸ“¦**Uninstall package by [Name]** block. Entering the name of a package will allow you to uninstall a Snapkg package.

## Contribution Guidelines

There are several ways to contribute to the Snapkg project, but before we get in, there are a few general guidelines that should be followed.

* Javascript blocks should not exist in the "default" repository due to their security concerns.

* A task should be created in the Github issue tracker for the following:
 
  - Before a new package is added to a repository
  - Major schema changes
  - Major Bugs, feature enhancements, etc.

* Tasks created in the issue tracker should remain open until a package has it's first release in it's production repository or until the Bug, feature enhancement, etc. has been resolved/completed.

* Commits should be clear and concise and should reference a Github issue number if feasible.

Below are just a few of the ways that you can help with the project:

* **Package Development**

  - Package development involves developing and updating a package's sources (xml).
  - Package developers should work with package maintainers when updating a package.

* **Package Maintainence**

  - Package maintainence includes keeping a package's index.json up-to-date.

* **Core Development**

  - Core development is the development of Snapkg itself.
  - It includes designing and maintaining the Snapkg package and repository schemas.

* **Documentation**

  - Documentation includes creating/editing Wikis, README's, and tutorials.

* **Community Engagement**

  - Engaging with the community by helping new users on the issue tracker and Snap! forums is a great way to promote Snapkg.

* **Testing/QA**

  - Testing Snapkg and it's packages is one way to ensure a smooth experience for end-users.
  - Issues should be reported in the issue tracker.
